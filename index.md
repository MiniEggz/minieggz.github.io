    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Owen, a PhD student at the University of Sheffield,
      supervised by <a href="https://deansong.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Xingyi Song</a>.
      I am particularly interested in investigating the reliability of data sources
      and NLP for social good. My work so far has focused on misinformation detection,
      news framing, and implementing the EffiARA annotation framework, available on 
      <a href="https://github.com/minieggz/effiara" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
      and
      <a href="https://pypi.org/project/effiara/" target="_blank" rel="nooperner noreferrer">PyPI</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background is in computer science; I graduated from the University
      of Sheffield in July 2024 with an MComp degree in computer science. As well
      as NLP research, I really enjoy learning things related to cyber
      security and software engineering.
